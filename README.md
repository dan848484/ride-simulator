# RideSimulator
I am a big fan of disney's rides and would like to investigate how they work especially for dark rides.

As a first step, I am going to create a simple ride's core logic in Kotlin.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to provide a ride backend logic that can interact with other components like audio animatoronics, lighting, and ride vehicles.
